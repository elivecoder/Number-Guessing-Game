📝 Project Description
This is a simple command-line number guessing game built using Python. The computer randomly selects a number within a given range, and the user attempts to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

📌 Features
Random number generation using Python's random module
Real-time user input and feedback
Conditional logic for hints
Looping until the correct guess is made
Tracks number of attempts
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Standard Library)

🎮 How to Play
Run the script using Python.
The computer will secretly choose a number (e.g., 1 to 100).
Enter your guesses one at a time.
Receive hints like:
"Too high"
"Too low"
"Correct!"
Game ends when you guess correctly.
